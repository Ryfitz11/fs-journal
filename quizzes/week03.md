# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
```
Encapsulation - every object has its own private state.
Abstraction - the process of selecting only relevant data.
Inheritance - some objects may inherit properties from other objects
Polymorphism - we can use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types.
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff.property
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
encapsulatoin is the grouping of data so that only the methods inside can be accessed and the rest can not be seen.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
```
Single resposibility principle - every class should have only one responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
```
the instance of the class can not modify the original class. 
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a copy of data from some dource
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the mvc pattern oragnizes like procedures together and helps to encapsulate the information
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
perform actions that the user can engage with.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
perform business logic
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
holds the information to create multiple variations of like ibjects.
```
