## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week went better than I expected. When we were given the task to clone a website I was feeling a little overwhelmed. It seemed like it would be dificult but after breaking it up into rows and columns it felt like it was starting to come together. Some of the rows were more chalenging than others. Using the @mdeia querry is still  confusing. I was able to figure out how to change the order of certain elements when the screen size got smaller. I had some trouble using themes for bootstrap. I am pretty sure it is because some where for later versions of bootstrap. I eventually found one that worked by coping all of it to my css.style file. I feel like there might be a better way to get pre made themes but this worked. My site is not perfect especially on mobile screens but it looks way better on a large screen.
