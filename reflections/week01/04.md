## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
  Wire-framing gives the developer an idea of where elements need to be and what colors/styles to use.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
  Low-fidelity means you dont spend too much time making it and does focus on that much detil. High-fidelity is going to be a lot more percise but take more time to produce.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think it depends on the developers situation. If you are deciding what the outcome will be than a low fidelity outline will work great. If you are making the webpage for someone else they might want a more detailed example so they can get a closer look of the final product.
