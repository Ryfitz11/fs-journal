## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

// 1 Function declaration: defines a named function and is hoisted, allowing the function to be used before it is defined.
function one(a,b){
  //statements
}

// 2 Function Expression: defines a named or anonymous function and is not hoisted, therefore cannot be used before they are defined.
let two = function (a,b){
  //statements
}

// 3 Arrow Function Expression: shorter syntax for writing a function
let three =(a,b) =>{
  //statements
}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
paramaters are place holders for functions. Arguments are the values that are used in the function.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
higher order functions have functions inside their paramaters.
