# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week started off tough but by the end of the week the mvc system is starting to make more sense. I sometimes have problems deciding wheather to use the controller or service. I know that the controller is used for interscting with the page and the service is for interacting with back end things.
